# Join Queries – Advanced SQL

This file contains examples of SQL joins using the Airbnb database schema.

# Queries Included:
1.INNER JOIN – Bookings with users
2.LEFT JOIN – Properties with or without reviews
3.FULL OUTER JOIN – All users and bookings, including unmatched records

These queries simulate real-world analytical scenarios, such as viewing all bookings, identifying unrated properties, and checking inactive users.
