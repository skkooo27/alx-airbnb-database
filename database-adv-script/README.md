# Join Queries – Advanced SQL

This file contains examples of SQL joins using the Airbnb database schema.

# Queries Included:
1.INNER JOIN – Bookings with users
2.LEFT JOIN – Properties with or without reviews
3.FULL OUTER JOIN – All users and bookings, including unmatched records

These queries simulate real-world analytical scenarios, such as viewing all bookings, identifying unrated properties, and checking inactive users.

# Subqueries – Advanced SQL

This file contains examples of using SQL subqueries in the Airbnb database schema.

### Queries Included:
1. **Properties with an average rating above 4.0** – using a non-correlated subquery with `HAVING`.
2. **Users with more than 3 bookings** – using a correlated subquery that filters by dynamic values from the outer query.

These queries demonstrate how to extract insights by nesting SELECT statements.
